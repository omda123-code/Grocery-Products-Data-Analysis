# üõí Grocery Products Data Analysis

## üìå Project Overview :
This project analyzes a dataset of grocery products (‚âà1750 items) including prices, discounts, ratings, and product descriptions.  
The goal is to clean the data, engineer useful features, and extract **business insights** about product performance, pricing, and customer preferences.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps of Analysis :

### 1. Data Understanding :
- Dataset shape: `(1757, 8)`
- Columns: `Sub Category, Price, Discount, Rating, Title, Currency, Feature, Product Description`
- Missing values detected in:
  - `Price` (3 missing).
  - `Rating` (1075 missing).
  - `Title` (5 missing).
  - `Currency` (5 missing).
  - `Feature` (18 missing).
  - `Product Description` (42 missing).

### 2. Data Cleaning :
- Removed `$` sign and converted **Price** to numeric.  
- Extracted **numeric rating** and **review count** from Rating text.  
- Filled missing prices with **median by Sub Category** ‚Üí fallback to overall median.  
- Standardized text features (lowercased, removed special characters).  
- Engineered `FinalPrice` (considering discount).  

### 3. Feature Engineering :
- **Bayesian Rating**: combines average rating with number of reviews for more robust ranking.  
- **Value Score**: normalized ratio of rating to price.  
- **Keyword Features**: extracted indicators like `is_organic`, `is_chocolate`, `is_kosher`, etc.  

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
Visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
- Distribution of product prices.
- Top subcategories by number of products.
- Rating vs Price scatter plot.
- Word frequency analysis in product titles.

## üöÄ Conclusion :
- **Organic & coffee products** lead in customer satisfaction.  
- Some high-value products deliver excellent price-to-rating ratios.  
- Several categories show **no discounts**, leaving room for marketing promotions.  
- Organic, kosher, and gluten-free keywords are strong positive drivers for ratings.  

## üìÇ Tech Stack :
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## üì¢ Next Steps :
- Deeper text analysis on product descriptions.  
- Time-based pricing and seasonal trend analysis (if dates available).  
- Comparison with competitor datasets.
